The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has raised concerns about its impact on society, prompting researchers to develop techniques for automated fake news detection. This project presented an analysis of fake news detection using data mining and machine learning methods. It leveraged a dataset comprising real and fake news articles collected from various sources and investigate the application of clustering and classification algorithms to identify patterns and distinguish between real and fake news.
